Open Source Software stands for software (programs, applications, packages...)
whose source code is available to the users and can be shared and modified. It
is commonly mistaken as free software, but it is not necessarily the case. The
aim of this page is to give an overview of what is Open Source Software (OSS).

OSS main goals are allowing free access to code around the world, without
discrimination of any kind and encouraging voluntary collaboration. Therefore,
OSS is more about a philosophy than a statement about the prize of the
program. There are many organizations and foundations whose main goal is to
protect and help open source projects. That is because OSS is not only sharing
the source code. To safeguard the open source philosophy, additional
requirements must be met. In addition to the availability of source code, there
is some consensus on considering the following
requirements as the identifying aspects of OSS: freedom of use, edition and
distribution.

### Freedom of use
OSS must allow its users to use it as they see fit. Its use can not be
restricted to a specific application. This gives the user to run the program
for any purpose they see fit, even if the program is not designed with that
specific goal in mind. Therefore, it allows the user to think for itself, free
of the constrictions that may be imposed otherwise by the owner of the
program.

### Freedom of edition
OSS must allow modifications on the original program. Thus, any user can fix
bugs of the program itself or it can tweak it to its specific needs.
This encourages voluntary contributions _de facto_ because, why should someone
who has received the program for free and fixed a bug not port the fix back to
the original program? This also generated a network of interconnected
programs, who build one on top of each other. What starts as some minor tweaks
can end up being a more specific version of the original program tailored to
some particular needs. The original program benefits from bug fixes that the
tweaked version may do, while the tweaked version benefits from the whole
original program, in a win win scenario.

### Freedom of distribution
Freedom of distribution encompasses both freedom to distribute the original
code (either for free or by a fee), and freedom to distribute modified
versions of the program. However, this distribution is still subjected to a
license. What changes from proprietary software are the conditions on the distribution
imposed by this license. OSS distribution must always provide the source code
as well as an open source license, that guarantees that the code can be both
sold or given away by redistributors.

## All of them combined
The open source philosophy provides a framework for voluntary collaboration
that allows OSS to be extremely competitive, high quality software while still
allowing OSS companies to sustain themselves via donations or selling
consulting and support services.

The apex of OSS benefits are supercomputers. All
[top 10 supercomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500#TOP_500)
in the world use Linux as its operating system. Moreover, they are also an
example of the economic value of OSS. Let's take the most powerful
supercomputer in the world, Summit at the OAK Ridge Laboratory. Its operating
system is Red Hat Enterprise Linux, based on Linux and Open Source itself, however, Red Hat sells
services and troubleshooting support, generating a revenue of $3.4 billion in 2018.
Moreover, [IBM is to buy Red Hat](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-red-hat-m-a-ibm/ibm-to-acquire-software-company-red-hat-for-34-billion-idUSKCN1N20N3)
for $34 billion. Another example closer to my home is the Barcelona
Supercomputing Center, whose supercomputer
[Mare Nostrum IV runs on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server](https://www.bsc.es/marenostrum/marenostrum/technical-information).
This operating system is also open source, distributed and developed by SUSE,
who offers similar support services to Red Hat. In this case, [SUSE was
bought](://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3035155/micro-focus-to-sell-suse-linux-to-private-equity-firm-for-usd25bn)
in 2018 for $2.5 billion. Here are SUSE's last release
