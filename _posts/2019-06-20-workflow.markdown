I have talked about the proposal, the blog, open source software, what my project is
about, and some weeks have passed since the start of the coding period, however, now
I realize I have yet to talk about what GSoC is and what is my daily routine as a
participant. This post will have two main sections, one little introduction
about GSoC (all the info about the program is available on
[its official site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)),
and a second larger section on my daily work routine.

### GSoC

Google Summer of Code is a global program organized by
[Google Open Source](https://opensource.google.com/). Its goal is at the same
time to support students by giving them the opportunity to work as programmers
during their summer and to empower and increase the open source software
community. It started in 2005 with 200 students, growing every year and
reaching 1276 accepted students in 2019.

GSoC has two selection phases, one for free open source projects and another
for students. Once the organizations have been selected, it is up to the
organizations alone to choose which students are accepted. Google's role is to
assign the number of student slots per organization, not who fills them.
I have not been
able to find much information about the slot assignment process, but it looks
like it depends on the number of proposals received and the total number of
students each organization is able to mentor.
Afterwards, during the summer, students code for their OSS project, while
getting paid by Google.

In order to make sure that both student and mentor are following the program
guidelines, there are two 15 minute evaluations, were the student has to answer some
questions abut the mentor and vice-versa. If passed, these evaluations trigger
the payment of part of the GSoC stipend. Eventually, there is a final
evaluation, were students must also write a summary of their work and links to
the code produced.
